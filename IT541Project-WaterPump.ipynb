    "Using data (**`WP_fulldataset.csv`**) provided from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, can you predict which pumps are **functional**, which are functional but need some repairs (**functional needs repair**), and which don't work at all (**non functional**)? Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.\n",
